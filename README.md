# Mobile-Price-Prediction-ML

This project is a Mobile Price prediction model that learns from the given dataset and predicts the prices of phones for different specs. It is based upon a linear regression model and tests data in a linear set followed by normalisation of the dataset by max-min. It includes the dataset of features like SALES (in lakhs[100000]),	WEIGHT (in grams),	RESOLUTION (in inch),	PPI	CPU CORE,	CPU FREQUENCY (in GHz),	INTERNAL MEMORY (in GB),	RAM (in GB),	REAR CAMERA (in MP),	FRONT CAMERA (in MP),	BATTER CAPACITY (in mAh),	THICKNESS (in mm),	PRICE (in 10 INRs). The data is extracted from Kaggle. 

The project first extracts data from the CSV using the pandas library and then follows to normalise the dataset. I have used normalisation through max-min since it gives a range of [0,1], which is effective for visualisation. I, then, split the data into two halves: train_set and test_set for both X and y. They were split with test size 0.4 and random state 1. Then, I declared a linear model for the dataset in vector form for faster implementation of the code. It then uses the standard cost function and plots it into a graph against the number of iterations. After that, It tests for accuracy by feeding the test set. I accuracy I achieved is 95.593% with an alpha of 0.06 and the number of iterations of 200. This was the most optimised value for accuracy, alpha and number of iterations that I could achieve.
